    The series follows the lives of persons of the same family through ages. I have absolutely fallen in love with this show. The writing, the characters, the emotion..everything just feels on par and real. This show will make you feel things. I really can't say it any better than that. Leave all of your politics and judgement at the door, and give this a chance.</p>
